In an ever changing world that’s constantly in competition with itself, one of things that’s strangely stayed the same is the education system. Now that everybody’s transitioning into, what feels like, a semi online life, it’s only fitting that we refine our ways of tutoring. This is where VR for education comes in.   The VR creates an immersive environment that allows individuals to fully indulge themselves into their field of interest. No more protests from students complaining about how textbooks with endless words tire them out, or how they can't visualize the study material. With VR, words on the page come to life. Be it learning a new language, about the vast endlessness of the universe or looking into the mysteries of your own body, VR learning makes everything simpler.   Studies confirm visual learning improves retention of information, the additive pleasure of being in an immersive online environment is the icing on the cake.   Making use of programming language C#, we allow the user to interact with the virtual environment and take in all the information at their own pace. No more pacing back and forth trying to memorize words in a book, the words take shape around you instead. 1
